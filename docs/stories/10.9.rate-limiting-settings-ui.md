# Story 10.9: Rate Limiting Settings UI

## Status
Draft

## Story
As an operator, I need a UI to view and adjust per-chat coverage proof rate limits with inline guidance about Telegram caps so I can tune delivery without violating the service guardrails described in `src/services/coverage_proof_service.py:47,520`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] UI lists coverage proof thresholds for each chat (messages per interval, burst allowance) populated from the service constants.
- [ ] Operators can edit thresholds with validation that keeps values within safe bounds; inline help explains Telegram caps before saving.
- [ ] A preview badge summarizes the effective rate limit (for example 1 msg/sec global, 1 msg/60s per chat) so operators see the impact immediately.
- [ ] Saving changes persists the values (either in Streamlit config or a settings table) and shows a toast with when the new limits take effect, plus logs the operator update.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Reuse the `CoverageProofService` state to populate the form.
- Implement validation logic to prevent values that exceed Telegram limits.

## Dev Notes
- Persist values to the same store the service uses on startup or to a new settings row linked to the coverage proof sender.

## Testing
- Unit tests cover validation/persistence, and `tests/unit/test_navigation_modernization.py:1` ensures the Rate Limiting page is discoverable from navigation.
