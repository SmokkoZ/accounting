# Story 10.4: Auto-refresh Default On

## Status
Draft

## Story
As an operator, I want the incoming bets queue to default to auto-refresh when fragment support is available so I can monitor the flow without manually toggling the setting, referencing the existing fragment flag around `src/ui/pages/1_incoming_bets.py:670`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Auto-refresh now defaults to ON whenever fragments are supported, but the operator can still disable it via the toggle.
- [ ] The refresh loop respects the spinner rate limit (no thrash) by only running once per configured interval and by using the fragment update when available.
- [ ] The current toggle state is visible in the UI and stored in session/query params for persistence.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Initialize the toggle from the fragment flag and store state in session.
- Ensure the refresh schedule uses the existing interval and disables itself cleanly when the toggle is off.

## Dev Notes
- Fall back to the old manual refresh when fragments are not supported.

## Testing
- Regression test to prove the spinner never thrashes while auto-refresh runs (could be a unit test for the toggled loop).
