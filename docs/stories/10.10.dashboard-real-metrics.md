# Story 10.10: Dashboard Real Metrics

## Status
Draft

## Story
As an operator, I want the Dashboard to show real counts for waiting incoming bets, approved bets today, open surebets, and pending settlements instead of demo metrics, referencing the incoming queue work at `src/ui/pages/1_incoming_bets.py` and the dashboard placeholder at `src/ui/pages/0_dashboard.py:26`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard cards replace demo data with actual counts for waiting incoming bets, approved bets today, open surebets, and pending settlements using the existing queries that feed the Incoming Bets and Surebets pages.
- [ ] Cards refresh automatically when the fragments-supported auto-refresh fires, reusing the same interval as the incoming queue and showing when the last refresh occurred.
- [ ] Metrics reference the renamed "Settlement" nav and link to the appropriate pages.
- [ ] The dashboard hosts action buttons for operational starters (send global Telegram statements, fetch FX rates, and other high-value actions) so operators can trigger them immediately when triage begins.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Replace the demo metric generator with real queries and wire the cards to the incoming queue refresh signal.
- Track the last refresh timestamp and show it in the UI.

## Dev Notes
- Provide a fallback count display when the query fails to avoid blank cards.

## Testing
- Update `tests/integration/test_telegram_approval_workflow.py:1` or navigation tests to assert dashboard metric refresh after a bet is approved.
