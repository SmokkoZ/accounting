# Story 9.9: Admin Bookmaker Financial Snapshot

## Status
Draft

## Story
As an operations admin, I want the “Admin & Associates” bookmaker table to surface each bookmaker’s cash position so I can see balances, pending exposure, and deposits without leaving the management surface.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] In the modern “Admin & Associates” page, the bookmaker editor hides the “Parsing Profile (JSON)”, “Created”, and “Updated” columns while keeping the existing editing experience for names, chats, and status.
- [ ] The bookmaker editor shows three read-only numeric columns:
  - `Balance (EUR)`: latest reported bookmaker balance (or blank when no check exists).
  - `Pending Balance (EUR)`: sum of all verified/matched bet stakes for that bookmaker.
  - `Deposits (EUR)`: net deposits (deposits minus withdrawals) recorded against that bookmaker.
- [ ] Balance/pending/deposits recalc automatically from the database so the table reflects the latest balance checks, bets, and funding transactions with no manual refresh.
- [ ] Sorting works for the new numeric columns and no longer offers the removed Created/Updated sort options.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Extend `load_bookmakers_for_associate` to annotate each bookmaker with latest reported balance, pending stake sum, and net deposits (all in EUR).
- [ ] Update the typed data editor dataframe/column config to drop the parsing profile + timestamps, add the three new read-only numeric columns, and keep associate filtering/additions working.
- [ ] Ensure bookmaker update/insert logic preserves existing parsing profiles even though the column is hidden from the editor.
- [ ] Refresh the Admin UI to pass the new metadata into the data editor and expose the updated columns with appropriate formatting and tooltips.

## Dev Notes

- Pending balance should reuse the same logic as `BookmakerBalanceService.get_pending_balance_summary` (verified/matched stakes in EUR) to avoid disagreements.
- Net deposits are derived from `ledger_entries` where `type IN ('DEPOSIT','WITHDRAWAL')` and `bookmaker_id` matches.
- Keep the older/legacy associate management components working by leaving the raw SQL query fields (`parsing_profile`, timestamps) untouched for those flows.
