# Story 10.1: Telegram Pending Photos Oversight

## Status
Draft

## Story
As an operator, I need a dedicated Pending Photos oversight table so I can see every TTL-limited confirm-before-ingest item and triage it with discard or force ingest actions that mirror the Telegram bot behavior described in `docs/front-end-spec.md:1`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The table lists chat_id, message_id, associate alias, bookmaker, and a TTL countdown (seconds until auto-discard) sourced from `pending_photos` (`src/core/schema.py:275`).
- [ ] Countdown updates every second, highlights entries approaching expiry, and greys them out when the same auto-discard path kicks in (`src/integrations/telegram_bot.py:2209`).
- [ ] Discard button is always visible, logs the operator and reason, reuses `src/integrations/telegram_bot.py:2209`, and removes the row and TTL clock once confirmed.
- [ ] Force Ingest button is hidden/off by default, mandates a justification modal, and calls `src/integrations/telegram_bot.py:1947` with the same approval flow plus `1998` and `2086` to mimic the bot while still logging the human override.
- [ ] Every action appends a structured event to the existing Telegram audit trail (message_id, operator, reason, outcome).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Query active rows from `pending_photos` and surface TTL along with the photo metadata.
- Reuse TTL logic from `src/integrations/telegram_bot.py` to keep the UI countdown in sync with the backend.
- Build an accessible justification modal for Force Ingest that captures operator name and reason.

## Dev Notes
- Force Ingest must respect the same admin gate as `src/integrations/telegram_bot.py:1947` so the UI cannot override policy.
- Keep the pending list in sync via fragments or short polling so the TTL countdown never drifts.

## Testing
- Extend `tests/integration/test_telegram_approval_workflow.py:1` to cover Discard and Force Ingest logging.
- Add a unit test for TTL formatting and the highlight/grey state transitions.
