# Story 10.7: Keyboard Shortcuts + Help Overlay

## Status
Draft

## Story
As an operator, I want page-specific hotkeys (A/R/E/ /?) with a help overlay so I can move through the workflow with minimal mouse travel, reusing the session-flag pattern from `src/ui/pages/8_associate_operations.py:477`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Page-local hotkeys (Approve=A, Reject=R, Edit=E, Search=/, Help=?) trigger the correct actions when focus is not inside an input, mirroring the focus gating used in `src/ui/pages/8_associate_operations.py:477`.
- [ ] The help overlay, opened with ?, lists the active shortcuts, closes with Escape, and explains the Telegram shortcuts.
- [ ] Operators can disable the hotkeys via a toggle; the state persists in session storage and is disabled when the overlay is open.
- [ ] Unit tests assert the session flag toggles and the overlay renders the expected list of shortcuts.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Implement key captures and the overlay component with accessible labels.
- Tie the session flag to the toggle and overlay state so the help list stays up to date.

## Dev Notes
- Ensure listener hooks detach when the focus moves into an input field to prevent accidental actions.

## Testing
- Add unit tests covering the session flag toggling and overlay content.
