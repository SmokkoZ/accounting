# Story 13.2: Associates Hub Overview & Funding Detail

## Status: Approved

## Story

**As the** single-operator accountant  
**I want** an Overview tab in the Associates Hub that surfaces ND/YF/TB/I'' for each associate with quick access to a shared detail view and funding dialogs  
**so that** I can understand who is overholding or short and perform deposits/withdrawals safely without leaving the hub.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Overview Tab Layout & Filters**  
   The Associates Hub includes an `Overview` tab that reuses the existing associate hub filter bar (search, admin/active status, bookmaker status, currency, sort) and displays a dashboard summary of associates, bookmakers, and identity metrics, using the current AssociateHubRepository projections. [Source: docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md; src/ui/components/associate_hub/filters.py; src/ui/components/associate_hub/listing.py]
2. **Per-Associate Operational View**  
   Below the dashboard, the Overview tab shows one card or row per associate with ND, FS, YF, TB, and I'' metrics, status (balanced/overholding/short), bookmaker counts, and last activity, following the existing Associate Operations Hub card styling and identity copy; these values are read-only and updated when funding transactions change. [Source: docs/stories/5.5.associate-operations-hub.md; docs/prd/epic-11-fair-balance-exit-settlement.md]
3. **Quick Actions Per Associate**  
   Each associate card/row offers quick actions: "Details", "Deposit", "Withdraw", and "Go to Management". "Go to Management" switches back to the Management tab with the same associate selected; "Details" opens the shared associate detail drawer; "Deposit" and "Withdraw" open funding dialogs prefilled with the associate. [Source: docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md]
4. **Shared Associate Detail Drawer (Profile/Balances/Transactions)**  
   The existing associate hub detail drawer is reused and wired into the new hub so that it can be opened from both Management and Overview, showing tabs for Profile, Balances, and Transactions. Profile exposes associate/bookmaker config consistent with Story 13.1; Balances shows per-bookmaker balances/ND/YF/TB/I'' context; Transactions lists funding transactions (deposits/withdrawals) for the selected associate/bookmaker. [Source: src/ui/components/associate_hub/drawer.py; docs/stories/5.5.associate-operations-hub.md]
5. **Funding Transactions View (Read-Only)**  
   The Transactions tab in the drawer presents a read-only table of funding transactions with columns such as timestamp, direction (deposit/withdrawal), amount, currency, optional bookmaker, operator, and note, populated via `FundingTransactionService` and existing ledger semantics; no inline editing of amounts is allowed. [Source: src/services/funding_transaction_service.py; docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md]
6. **Funding Dialogs for Deposits/Withdrawals**  
   Clicking "Deposit" or "Withdraw" opens a dialog that requires direction, amount, currency, optional bookmaker, and optional note; on confirm, it records a new funding transaction via the existing service (wrapping ledger entries), updates ND/TB/I'' metrics, and shows a success/error toast. Amount fields validate as positive decimals and use the same FX and ledger conventions as current funding flows. [Source: docs/stories/5.5.associate-operations-hub.md; docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]
7. **No Telegram-Specific Funding on Overview Tab**  
   The Overview tab and the detail drawer do not display Telegram funding-draft panels or Telegram-only actions; Telegram workflows remain on the existing Telegram/Associate Operations pages and will move to a separate Telegram Hub in a different epic. [Source: docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md]
8. **State & Deep Linking Behaviour**  
   The Overview tab respects the `selected_associate` state set by the Management tab; when entered via "Go to Overview" it highlights or scrolls to that associate and opens the drawer/funding dialogs in the correct context without losing filter state.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Wire Overview tab and dashboard (AC: 1, 2, 8)**  
  - [ ] Extend the new `src/ui/pages/7_associates_hub.py` page so the second tab renders an Overview surface, using `render_filters` to manage search/filters/sorting and `render_hub_dashboard` to show top-level metrics. [Source: src/ui/components/associate_hub/filters.py; src/ui/components/associate_hub/listing.py]  
  - [ ] Reuse `AssociateHubRepository` to fetch `AssociateMetrics` and any required bookmaker summaries with the same identity definitions used in `8_associate_operations.py`. [Source: src/repositories/associate_hub_repository.py; src/ui/pages/8_associate_operations.py]  
  - [ ] Ensure that when `selected_associate_id` is present in session state (set by Management), the Overview tab either scrolls to or visually highlights that associate’s row/card. [Source: src/ui/utils/state_management.py]

- [ ] **Task 2: Integrate associate cards and quick actions (AC: 2, 3, 8)**  
  - [ ] Use the existing associate hub listing/card component to render one row/card per associate with ND/FS/YF/TB/I'' and status, ensuring these remain read-only. [Source: src/ui/components/associate_hub/listing.py]  
  - [ ] Attach quick action buttons "Details", "Deposit", "Withdraw", and "Go to Management" to each card, wiring them to session state so they open the drawer, open funding dialogs, or flip back to the Management tab with the selected associate retained. [Source: docs/stories/5.5.associate-operations-hub.md]  
  - [ ] Confirm that quick actions do not duplicate money-moving controls on the Management tab and that they do not trigger Telegram-specific workflows. [Source: docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md]

- [ ] **Task 3: Refine and reuse shared detail drawer (AC: 4, 5, 7)**  
  - [ ] Audit `render_detail_drawer` to ensure its Profile, Balances, and Transactions tabs match the fields and validations now exposed on the Management tab, aligning labels and optional/required fields. [Source: src/ui/components/associate_hub/drawer.py; docs/stories/7.1.associate-management-ui.md; docs/stories/7.2.bookmaker-management-ui.md]  
  - [ ] Ensure the Balances tab surfaces the same ND/YF/TB/I'' identity metrics and bookmaker balance comparisons defined in the reconciliation and balance drilldown stories. [Source: docs/stories/5.2.reconciliation-dashboard-associate-view.md; docs/stories/5.3.bookmaker-balance-drilldown.md]  
  - [ ] Confirm that the Transactions tab lists funding transactions via `FundingTransactionService` and does not expose Telegram-specific controls; any Telegram notifications remain handled by existing services but are not surfaced as primary UI here. [Source: src/services/funding_transaction_service.py; src/services/telegram_notifier.py]

- [ ] **Task 4: Implement deposit/withdraw dialogs and tests (AC: 5, 6, 7)**  
  - [ ] Implement deposit/withdraw dialogs that validate positive decimal amounts, supported currencies, optional bookmaker, and optional note, and then call `FundingTransactionService` to record entries, reusing patterns from the Associate Operations Hub. [Source: docs/stories/5.5.associate-operations-hub.md; src/services/funding_transaction_service.py]  
  - [ ] Update aggregate metrics in-memory after successful funding operations so ND/TB/I'' reflect the new transactions without a full app restart, following existing incremental update patterns where feasible. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]  
  - [ ] Add unit and integration tests to assert that: (a) funding operations called from the Overview tab create correct ledger-backed transactions; (b) ND/TB/I'' metrics update as expected; (c) invalid inputs are rejected with inline error messages; and (d) no Telegram-only funding panels are rendered.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 5.5 (Associate Operations Hub) already defines the associate operations dashboard, identity metrics, and funding flows; this story repositions and narrows that functionality into an Overview tab without Telegram-specific panels. [Source: docs/stories/5.5.associate-operations-hub.md]  
- Story 11.1 and related Epic 11 work established the ND/YF/TB/I'' identity and its use across reconciliation and statements; the Overview tab must present these metrics consistently. [Source: docs/stories/11.1.nd-sign-consistency-and-identity-adoption.md; docs/prd/epic-11-fair-balance-exit-settlement.md]

### Data & Services

- Associate metrics for ND, FS, YF, TB, and I'' come from `AssociateHubRepository` and should not alter the underlying calculation logic; funding operations merely add new ledger-backed entries that these projections consume. [Source: src/repositories/associate_hub_repository.py; docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md]  
- Funding transactions are persisted via `FundingTransactionService` and related services that currently power the Associate Operations Hub; this story reuses that service layer rather than introducing new ad-hoc ledger writes. [Source: src/services/funding_transaction_service.py; docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]

### UI & UX

- The Overview tab emphasises operational metrics and quick actions while maintaining a clear separation between configuration (Management tab) and money movements (dialogs/detail view). [Source: docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md]  
- Telegram workflows (pending drafts, approvals, coverage proof notifications) remain on existing Telegram and Associate Operations pages and will be migrated into a dedicated Telegram Hub in a separate epic, keeping this Overview tab scope clean.
