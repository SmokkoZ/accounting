# Story 10.2: Coverage Proof Outbox & Resend

## Status
Draft

## Story
As an operator, I need a Coverage Proof outbox so I can see the status of each delivery, resend when needed, and observe rate-limit cooldowns without spamming Telegram, following the UX guidance in `docs/front-end-spec.md:1`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The outbox table lists every row from `multibook_message_log` with associate_alias, chat_id, message_id, status, last_attempt, and the seconds until the next allowed send, matching the logging surface at `src/services/coverage_proof_service.py:47`.
- [ ] Each row exposes a Resend button that calls `CoverageProofService.send` with `resend=True`, honors the cooldown at `src/services/coverage_proof_service.py:520`, disables during the wait, and surfaces success/failure toasts.
- [ ] The UI surfaces per-chat rate-limit health (queued/blocked) and logs scrape events for analytics.
- [ ] Inline guidance explains safe Telegram caps and why the button may be disabled (per `docs/front-end-spec.md:1`).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Reuse the service that writes to `multibook_message_log`.
- Decorate the Resend button with spinner/toast flows while the service runs.

## Dev Notes
- Rate-limit copy should pull from existing constants so warnings stay accurate if values change.

## Testing
- Add unit tests for `src/services/coverage_proof_service.py` asserting `resend=True` uses the cooldown state.
- Confirm `tests/unit/test_media_thumbnails.py:1` continues to pass even though the Telegram section will host new tables near thumbnail rows.
