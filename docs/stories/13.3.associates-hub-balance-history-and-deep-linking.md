# Story 13.3: Associates Hub Balance History & Deep Linking

## Status: Approved

## Story

**As the** single-operator accountant  
**I want** a Balance History tab in the Associates Hub with deep links from Management and Overview  
**so that** I can analyse historical ND/TB/I'' trends per associate/bookmaker and export the data without leaving the hub.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Balance History Tab & Filters**  
   The Associates Hub includes a `Balance History` tab that provides filters for associate, bookmaker, and date range; when opened directly it defaults to "All associates" with a reasonable recent date window, and when opened via deep link it inherits the selected associate (and optional bookmaker) from Management or Overview. [Source: docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md]
2. **Deep Linking from Management & Overview**  
   Clicking "View history" from an associate row on the Management tab or from an Overview card switches to the Balance History tab and applies the appropriate associate/bookmaker filters, without resetting other global hub filters unnecessarily. [Source: docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md; src/ui/utils/state_management.py]
3. **Historical Charts for ND/TB/I''**  
   The Balance History tab shows at least one time-series chart that plots ND, TB, and I'' (and optionally YF) across the selected date range for the filtered associate/bookmaker, using the existing reconciliation/balance datasets so the curves match other finance views. [Source: docs/stories/5.2.reconciliation-dashboard-associate-view.md; docs/stories/5.3.bookmaker-balance-drilldown.md]
4. **Historical Table View**  
   Beneath the chart, a table lists historical balance snapshots with columns such as date/time, associate, bookmaker, ND, YF, TB, I'', currency, and source (e.g. balance check vs. ledger aggregate), reusing the same conventions and thresholds from prior reconciliation and balance stories. [Source: docs/stories/5.3.bookmaker-balance-drilldown.md; docs/prd/epic-5-corrections-reconciliation.md]
5. **XLSX Export of Filtered History**  
   The Balance History tab exposes an "Export Excel" or "Download Excel" control that exports the currently filtered history to an `.xlsx` file, matching the Excel styling and typing rules introduced when CSV exports were replaced in Epic 12. [Source: docs/stories/12.2.replace-csv-with-styled-xlsx-exports.md; docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md]
6. **Performance & UX Guardrails**  
   History queries are constrained by the selected date range and pagination to avoid locking the UI on large datasets; empty-result and error states are surfaced with helpful copy instead of failing silently. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md; docs/stories/5.3.bookmaker-balance-drilldown.md]
7. **No Telegram-Specific Data on History Tab**  
   The Balance History tab presents ledger/balance history only and does not surface Telegram message history, coverage proof events, or other Telegram-specific workflow details. [Source: docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Implement Balance History tab shell (AC: 1, 6, 7)**  
  - [x] Extend the `src/ui/pages/7_associates_hub.py` page so the third tab renders a Balance History surface with associate/bookmaker/date filters and clear empty-state messaging. [Source: docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md; docs/prd/ui-specification.md]  
  - [x] Connect filters to session state so the selected associate/bookmaker/date range survive reruns and navigation within the hub. [Source: src/ui/utils/state_management.py]  
  - [x] Ensure that no Telegram-specific metrics or message details are queried or displayed on this tab. [Source: docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md]

- [x] **Task 2: Wire deep-linking from Management and Overview (AC: 2)**  
  - [x] Add "View history" actions on Management and Overview that set `selected_associate_id`, optional `selected_bookmaker_id`, and a target tab indicator in session state, then trigger a safe rerun. [Source: docs/stories/13.1.associates-hub-management-tab.md; docs/stories/13.2.associates-hub-overview-and-funding-detail.md; src/ui/utils/state_management.py]  
  - [x] On rerun, detect the target tab indicator to switch to the Balance History tab and pre-populate filters with the selected associate/bookmaker while leaving other hub filters (e.g. currency) intact. [Source: docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md]  
  - [x] Add a breadcrumb or caption indicating which associate/bookmaker and date range are currently in focus so the operator understands the context of the deep link.

- [x] **Task 3: Build historical charts and table (AC: 3, 4, 6)**  
  - [x] Reuse or extend the existing reconciliation/balance services to fetch historical ND/TB/I'' (and optionally YF) series for the selected associate/bookmaker and date range, using the same identity formulas as elsewhere. [Source: docs/stories/5.2.reconciliation-dashboard-associate-view.md; docs/stories/5.3.bookmaker-balance-drilldown.md; docs/prd/epic-11-fair-balance-exit-settlement.md]  
  - [x] Render one or more time-series charts (e.g. line charts) showing ND, TB, and I'' over time; tooltips should include exact values and timestamps. [Source: docs/architecture/Frontend_Architecture_v5.md]  
  - [x] Render a paginated table listing per-snapshot fields (timestamp, associate, bookmaker, ND, YF, TB, I'', currency, source) with sorting options (date, imbalance magnitude, associate/bookmaker). [Source: docs/stories/5.3.bookmaker-balance-drilldown.md]  
  - [x] Protect performance by limiting default date ranges (e.g. last 30–90 days) and paginating long histories, with clear messaging when filters are too broad or return no rows. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]

- [x] **Task 4: Implement XLSX export and tests (AC: 5, 6)**  
  - [x] Add an "Export Excel" control that calls a dedicated export function to write the currently filtered history to an `.xlsx` workbook, reusing the styling and numeric typing rules introduced in Story 12.2. [Source: docs/stories/12.2.replace-csv-with-styled-xlsx-exports.md; src/services/ledger_service.py]  
  - [x] Ensure the exported sheet preserves row/column ordering from the on-screen table and includes the key filters (associate/bookmaker/date range) in either a header row or file metadata. [Source: docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md]  
  - [x] Add unit tests that open the generated workbook in memory and assert that ND/TB/I'' columns are numeric and that the row count matches the filtered result set, plus at least one integration test that runs the export end-to-end from the UI. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story & Epic Context

- Story 5.3 (Bookmaker Balance Drilldown) defines how modeled vs. reported balances, differences, and status thresholds are computed; the Balance History tab should reuse these calculations rather than introducing new ones. [Source: docs/stories/5.3.bookmaker-balance-drilldown.md]  
- Story 5.2 (Reconciliation Dashboard Associate View) and Epic 11 specify the ND/YF/TB/I'' identity and visual conventions used across reconciliation surfaces; historical charts must remain consistent with those views. [Source: docs/stories/5.2.reconciliation-dashboard-associate-view.md; docs/prd/epic-11-fair-balance-exit-settlement.md]  
- Story 12.2 (Replace CSV with Styled XLSX Exports) introduced `.xlsx` export styling and typing rules, which this story adopts for balance history exports. [Source: docs/stories/12.2.replace-csv-with-styled-xlsx-exports.md]

### Data & Services

- Historical ND/TB/I'' data is derived from the same ledger and balance check tables used by reconciliation and balance drilldown flows; this story adds new read models and visualizations but does not change how ledger data is stored. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5-corrections-reconciliation.md; docs/architecture/data-architecture.md]  
- Export logic should sit alongside existing ledger/statement exporters to avoid duplicating workbook generation concerns, sharing the same libraries and formatting conventions. [Source: src/services/ledger_service.py; docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### UX & Navigation

- Deep linking from Management/Overview into Balance History is central to the Associates Hub concept; the selected associate/bookmaker must be obvious when viewing trends so the operator can quickly pivot between config, current status, and history. [Source: docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md]  
- The Balance History tab remains focused on financial history; Telegram message history and coverage proof flows are explicitly out of scope and should be handled by a separate Telegram Hub. [Source: docs/prd/epic-13-associates-hub-brownfield-enhancement.md]

## QA Results

### Risk Assessment
- **Complexity**: 4/5 - The tab introduces a new Streamlit surface, session-state coordination from two other tabs, and a bespoke data service plus export path.
- **Data Sensitivity**: High - Surfaces ledger-backed ND/TB/I'' plus bookmaker balances that drive financial reporting.
- **Integration Risk**: 3/5 - Depends on ledger_entries aggregations, balance check history, and cross-tab state; regressions spill into Management/Overview.
- **Overall Risk Score**: 12 (Medium) - High-impact data with several medium-likelihood failure points around pagination, exports, and performance.

### NFR Analysis
- **Security**: PASS - The feature is read-only and reuses the existing Associates Hub authentication envelope.
- **Performance**: CONCERNS - `_calculate_financials` runs a ledger aggregation per row (`src/services/balance_history_service.py:271-330`), so a 5k-row export issues 5k full-table scans and is likely to thrash or time out.
- **Reliability**: CONCERNS - History charts/export payloads consume only the paginated subset fetched with `limit=page_size` (`src/ui/pages/7_associates_hub.py:1635-1694`), and exports silently drop rows past 5k (`src/services/balance_history_service.py:130-174`), so operators cannot trust the view to represent the entire date window.
- **Usability**: CONCERNS - There is no warning that the chart excludes older rows or that exports truncate beyond 5k rows (`src/ui/pages/7_associates_hub.py:1724-1742`), forcing users to guess which subset they are seeing.
- **Maintainability**: PASS - The new logic lives in a dedicated, unit-tested service with dataclasses and clear interfaces, easing future refactors.

### Test Strategy
- Add Streamlit/AppTest coverage that clicks "View history" from Management/Overview and asserts the Balance History tab inherits filters and preserves other hub state (current tests only stub the service in `tests/ui/test_associates_hub_management_tab.py:1-140`).
- Extend automation so the chart and Excel export are validated across >1 page of rows and large date windows; today only `tests/unit/test_balance_history_service.py:58-118` exercises happy-path calculations.
- Introduce load/timeout protection (or contract tests) for the 5k-row export path to ensure long histories do not DOS the app.

### Requirements Traceability
- **AC1**: Partially covered – Filters/defaults exist in `src/ui/pages/7_associates_hub.py:1484-1608`, but there is no regression coverage proving the default window or deep-link inheritance works.
- **AC2**: Not covered – "View history" actions on Management and Overview (`src/ui/pages/7_associates_hub.py:619-663, 1246-1336`) lack automated verification that session state transitions and other hub filters remain intact.
- **AC3**: Partially covered – BalanceHistoryService computes ND/YF/TB (see `tests/unit/test_balance_history_service.py:58-88`), yet the chart only plots whichever rows are in the current page (`src/ui/pages/7_associates_hub.py:1635-1694`), so long ranges are incomplete.
- **AC4**: Not covered – The tabular history/pagination (`src/ui/pages/7_associates_hub.py:1698-1722`) is untested and omits older rows unless the user manually pages through.
- **AC5**: Partially covered – Workbook typing is unit-tested (`tests/unit/test_balance_history_service.py:104-118`), but exports silently cap at 5k rows without UI disclosure (`src/services/balance_history_service.py:130-174; src/ui/pages/7_associates_hub.py:1724-1742`) and there is no integration/E2E test.
- **AC6**: Not covered – Guardrails/empty-state copy exist (`src/ui/pages/7_associates_hub.py:1568-1659`), yet no automation exercises error states, pagination bounds, or large-window warnings.
- **AC7**: Covered – The shared drawer is rendered with `show_telegram_actions=False` so Telegram UIs cannot bleed into this tab (`src/ui/pages/7_associates_hub.py:1861-1868`).

### Quality Gate Decision
- **Decision**: CONCERNS
- **Risk Score**: 12
- **Rationale**: Charts and exports operate only on the paginated subset of rows while Excel downloads truncate after the first 5k records and rely on thousands of ledger scans, so operators lack an accurate end-to-end view and the flows are poised to stall under realistic history sizes.
- **Recommendations**:
  1. Decouple chart/export queries from the paginated table so the full date window is plotted/exported, and surface an explicit warning when truncation occurs.
  2. Batch or precompute ledger metrics for history rows instead of calling `_calculate_financials` per row to eliminate the O(n) ledger scans that make exports fragile.
  3. Add Streamlit/AppTest scenarios that deep-link into Balance History, flip between pages, trigger exports, and verify the resulting workbook to guard against regressions.
