## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the foundation story.

### Data Models
No specific data models for this story - database schema will be created in Story 0.2.

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for this story.

### Component Specifications
Streamlit app scaffold should include:
- Basic page configuration with `st.set_page_config(layout="wide")` [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#105-106]
- Navigation structure for future pages [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#366-384]

### File Locations
Based on architecture documentation:
- `app.py` - Main Streamlit entry point [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#365]
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#94-122]
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#66-91]
- `README.md` - Project documentation [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#125-137]
- `.env.example` - Environment template [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#51-63]
- `data/` directory structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#140-159]
- `src/` directory structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#191-438]
- `tests/` directory structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#442-469]

### Testing Requirements
From testing strategy:
- Set up pytest configuration [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#36-41]
- Create test directory structure [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#54-77]
- No specific tests required for this story, but test infrastructure should be in place

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.12+ required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#19]
- Use venv for virtual environment [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#269-283]
- Line length: 100 characters for Black formatter [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#20]
- All currency values must use Decimal (not float) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#96-113]
- All timestamps in UTC with "Z" suffix [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#198-226]

### Project Structure Notes
The project structure should follow the documented source tree:
- Root level: configuration files, README, requirements
- `src/` directory with subdirectories: core/, services/, integrations/, models/, ui/, utils/, jobs/
- `tests/` directory with subdirectories: unit/, integration/, e2e/, fixtures/
- `data/` directory (git-ignored) for database, screenshots, exports, logs

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- Use pytest 7.0+ as testing framework [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#36]
- Test file naming: `test_` prefix [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#452-464]
- Test function naming: descriptive names [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#467-483]
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#487-501]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The project setup demonstrates excellent adherence to architectural standards and coding conventions. All required components have been implemented with proper structure and configuration. The Streamlit application scaffold follows the documented navigation pattern and provides a solid foundation for future development.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was required as the implementation already follows best practices and coding standards.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All code follows PEP 8 with 100-character line length
- Project Structure: ✓ Directory structure matches architecture documentation
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Test infrastructure in place with proper configuration
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Verified all dependencies in requirements.txt meet minimum version requirements
- [x] Confirmed pytest configuration follows testing strategy guidelines
- [x] Validated mypy configuration enforces type checking
- [x] Ensured .gitignore excludes sensitive data and temporary files
- [x] Confirmed README provides comprehensive setup instructions
- [x] Validated .env.example includes all required environment variables
- [x] Verified Streamlit app follows navigation structure from architecture

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation properly excludes sensitive files (.env, data/) from version control and uses environment variables for configuration.

### Performance Considerations

No performance issues identified. The project setup is minimal and follows best practices for a Python web application.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review.
