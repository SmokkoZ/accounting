## Story

**As the operator**, I want to compare modeled bookmaker balances against reported live balances to identify missing transactions so I can apply corrections for discrepancies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Bookmaker drilldown interface**: Reconciliation page includes expandable per-bookmaker breakdown or separate drilldown tab
- [ ] **Per-bookmaker data display**: Grouped by associate + bookmaker with modeled vs. reported comparison
- [ ] **Modeled Balance calculation**:
  - Query: `SUM(amount_eur)` from all `ledger_entries` WHERE `associate_id=X AND bookmaker_id=Y`
  - Convert to native currency: `modeled_native = modeled_eur / fx_rate`
  - Display: "€XXX (YYY AUD)" where YYY is approximate native equivalent
- [ ] **Reported Live Balance display**:
  - From `bookmaker_balance_checks` table with manual entry capability
  - Display: "ZZZ AUD (€AAA)" with timestamp "Last checked: X hours ago"
- [ ] **Difference calculation**:
  - `difference_native = reported_native - modeled_native`
  - `difference_eur = difference_native * fx_rate`
  - Color coding:
    - **🟢 Green** if `|difference_eur| < €10`: "Balanced"
    - **🟡 Yellow** if `10 <= |difference_eur| < €50`: "Minor mismatch"
    - **🔴 Red** if `|difference_eur| >= €50`: "Major mismatch - investigate"
- [ ] **Float attribution**: For any positive DELTA (overholding), display the counterpart associates who are short (negative DELTA) for that bookmaker and show the exact amounts owed so operators know who the excess belongs to
- [ ] **"Apply Correction" button**: Pre-fills correction form (Story 5.1) with:
  - Associate: X
  - Bookmaker: Y
  - Amount: `difference_native` (to bring modeled in line with reported)
  - Currency: bookmaker's currency
  - Note: "Balance reconciliation for [bookmaker] on [date]"
- [ ] **Manual balance entry form**: Inline form with associate selector, bookmaker selector, balance amount (native currency), "Update Balance" button
- [ ] **Bookmaker balance checks table**: 
  - Insert/update `bookmaker_balance_checks` row on "Update Balance"
  - Show timestamp of last balance check
- [ ] **Table filtering features**: 
  - Sortable by difference (largest first)
  - Filter: show only mismatches option
  - Collapsible associate rows with bookmaker detail breakdown
- [ ] **Data integrity**: Balance checks do NOT auto-create corrections (operator decides)


UI Concept

Associate Summary Grid

Accordion rows per associate showing their total modeled vs. reported balance, DELTA, and quick status badge.
DELTA pill uses red/green/yellow background; clicking the row expands bookmaker cards underneath.
Bookmaker Cards (inside associate accordion)

Each bookmaker renders as a card with two columns: “Modeled” (calculated € + native) and “Reported” (latest check), separator, and a prominent “Difference” stripe on the right.
Stripe colour mirrors the mismatch severity; directly beneath it sits an “Apply Correction” button plus “Update Balance” inline form.
Float Attribution Drawer

If the difference is positive (overholding), a small link “See who this belongs to” opens a slide-over drawer.
Drawer groups counterpart associates who are short: each row lists associate name, owed amount, and how much of the overholding remains unallocated; a simple waterfall ensures totals balance to zero.
You can export the attribution list directly from the drawer.
Global Filters & Sorting

Toolbar at top with toggle chips: “All”, “Mismatches only”, “Overholders”, “Short”.
Sort dropdown defaults to “Largest mismatch”; date picker narrows by last balance check.
Context Pane

Right-side info panel summarises instructions: explains modeled vs. reported, the meaning of positive/negative DELTAs, and shows quick totals (total overheld, total owed).
This layout keeps the high-level picture clear while making drill-down and counterparty attribution one click away. Let me know if you’d like a mockup or Streamlit component sketch.

```python
# UPSERT operation for balance checks
def update_reported_balance(self, associate_id: int, bookmaker_id: int, balance_native: Decimal, currency: str, note: Optional[str] = None):

- Epic 7 (User Management): Associates and bookmakers reference data
- Epic 0 (Foundation): FX rate system for currency conversion

**Downstream Consumers**:
- Story 5.4 (Funding Events): May affect bookmaker-specific holdings
- Epic 6 (Reporting): Uses bookmaker balance data for detailed statements

**UI Integration**:
- Extension of existing reconciliation page (src/ui/pages/6_reconciliation.py)
- Integration with correction form pre-fill workflow
- Real-time balance comparison and status updates
- Export functionality for bookmaker-level balance reports

### Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Major Mismatch Scenario**
```
Bookmaker: Bet365 (Admin)
Modeled Balance: €500.00 (€500.00 ÷ 0.65 = €769.23 AUD)
Reported Balance: €450.00 AUD (€450.00 × 0.65 = €292.50 EUR)
Difference: €292.50 - €500.00 = -€207.50 EUR
Status: 🔴 Red - "Major mismatch - investigate"
Action: "Apply Correction" pre-fills +€450.00 AUD correction
```

**Example 2: Minor Mismatch Scenario**
```
Bookmaker: DraftKings (Partner A)
Modeled Balance: €750.00 (€750.00 ÷ 0.72 = €1,041.67 USD)
Reported Balance: €1,080.00 USD (€1,080.00 × 0.72 = €777.60 EUR)
Difference: €777.60 - €750.00 = +€27.60 EUR
Status: 🟡 Yellow - "Minor mismatch"
Action: Monitor or apply small correction if persistent
```

**Example 3: Balanced Scenario**
```
Bookmaker: Unibet (Partner B)
Modeled Balance: €320.00 (€320.00 ÷ 0.58 = €551.72 EUR)
Reported Balance: €560.00 EUR (€560.00 × 0.58 = €324.80 EUR)
Difference: €324.80 - €320.00 = +€4.80 EUR
Status: 🟢 Green - "Balanced"
Action: No action required
```

### Testing Standards

**Test Framework** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit-Testing]:
- Use pytest 7.0+ as testing framework
- Test file naming: `test_` prefix
- Test function naming: descriptive names (e.g., `test_calculate_bookmaker_balance_difference()`)

```

**UI Testing Approach** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Integration-Testing]:
For Streamlit bookmaker drilldown interface:
1. **Unit tests** for bookmaker balance service business logic
2. **Unit tests** for balance check repository operations
3. **Integration tests** for complete bookmaker reconciliation workflow
4. **Manual testing** for drilldown display and correction pre-fill

### Test Data Requirements

**Required Test Fixtures**:
- Associates with multiple bookmakers each
- Various ledger entry scenarios: bets on different bookmakers, corrections
- Balance checks with different timestamps and values
- Multiple currencies with corresponding FX rates
- Edge cases: bookmakers with no entries, missing balance checks
- Validation scenarios: malformed data, missing foreign keys

**Balance Check Test Scenarios**:
- New balance check (INSERT operation)
- Existing balance check update (UPDATE operation via UNIQUE constraint)
- Balance checks with different currencies than bookmaker default
- Stale balance checks (older than expected threshold)
