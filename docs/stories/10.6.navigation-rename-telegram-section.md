# Story 10.6: Navigation Rename & Telegram Section

## Status
Draft

## Story
As an operator, I want the navigation label to say "Settlement" instead of "Verified Bets Queue", to get a dedicated Telegram section, and to see live balances on the Associates page, following `docs/front-end-spec.md:1` and the repository structure at `src/repositories/associate_hub_repository.py:70`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The main navigation label reads "Settlement" and keeps "Surebets" for discovery (update at `src/ui/app.py:105`).
- [ ] A new Telegram section links to Pending Photos, Coverage Proof Outbox, and Rate Limiting pages.
- [ ] The Admin & Associates listing now surfaces `balance` and `pending_balance` instead of JSON profile/created/updated columns, and sorting/filtering use these new fields via `AssociateHubRepository`.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_navigation_modernization.py:1` asserts the Settlement label and Telegram section exist.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_associate_hub_repository.py:1` covers the new fields so data is available to the UI.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Update nav data structure and page registry.
- Add the Telegram section routing to Stories 10.1, 10.2, and 10.9.
- Refresh the AssociateHub UI to display the new columns and remove the old JSON fields.

## Dev Notes
- Update any SQL or repo filters that expect the removed JSON/created columns so type errors do not surface.

## Testing
- Navigation test updates as above.
- AssociateHub repository tests ensure new fields exist and carry correct values.
