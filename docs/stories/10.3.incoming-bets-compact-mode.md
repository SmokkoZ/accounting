# Story 10.3: Incoming Bets Compact Mode

## Status
Draft

## Story
As an operator, I want a compact incoming bets layout so I can scan more rows without losing context, reusing the compact mode toggle referenced at `src/ui/pages/1_incoming_bets.py:494` and the card spacing logic from `src/ui/components/bet_card.py:125`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A page-wide toggle persists in session state and flips `compact_mode` so vertical padding shrinks and thumbnails narrow when active.
- [ ] Compact mode passes `compact_mode=True` to `render_bet_card`, shrinks thumbnails, and avoids layout shifts while a row is expanded or edited.
- [ ] The toggle value survives refresh via query params/local pref so the operator does not re-enable it every visit.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Add the toggle in the toolbar and wire its state to `render_bet_card`.
- Adjust the thumbnail width fallback when `compact_mode` is true.

## Dev Notes
- Maintain readability of all fields (confidence, market, odds) even though padding is reduced.

## Testing
- Update `tests/unit/test_media_thumbnails.py:1` to ensure the compact layout still renders thumbnails correctly.
