# Story 5.4: Pending Funding Events

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

**As the operator**, I want to review and approve deposit/withdrawal events so associate balances reflect cash movements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] "Pending Funding" section at top of Reconciliation page

  **Manual Entry Form** (for MVP, no Telegram auto-capture):
  - **Associate selector**: Dropdown
  - **Event type**: Radio buttons (DEPOSIT | WITHDRAWAL)
  - **Amount**: Number input (native currency, positive only)
  - **Currency selector**: Dropdown
  - **Note**: Optional text field (e.g., "Bank transfer from Partner A")
  - **"Add Funding Event" button**: Creates draft entry

- [ ] Pending funding list:
  - Shows draft entries (in-memory or separate `funding_drafts` table)
  - Display: timestamp, associate, type, amount, currency, note
  - Actions: **Accept** | **Reject** buttons

- [ ] On "Accept":
  - Get current FX rate: `fx_rate = get_fx_rate(currency, today)`
  - Insert `ledger_entries` row:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO ledger_entries (
      entry_type,            -- 'DEPOSIT' or 'WITHDRAWAL'
      associate_id,
      bookmaker_id,          -- NULL (funding is associate-level, not bookmaker-specific)
      surebet_id,            -- NULL
      bet_id,                -- NULL
      settlement_state,      -- NULL
      amount_native,         -- from form (positive for DEPOSIT, negative for WITHDRAWAL)
      native_currency,       -- from form
      fx_rate_snapshot,      -- current rate
      amount_eur,            -- amount_native * fx_rate_snapshot
      principal_returned_eur,-- NULL
      per_surebet_share_eur, -- NULL
      settlement_batch_id,   -- NULL
      created_at_utc,        -- current timestamp
      created_by,            -- 'local_user'
      note                   -- from form
    ) VALUES (...)
    ```
  - Remove from drafts list
  - Success message: "Funding event accepted. Ledger entry created."
  - Reconciliation dashboard updates immediately (NET_DEPOSITS_EUR changes)

- [ ] On "Reject":
  - Remove from drafts list
  - No ledger write
  - Success message: "Funding event discarded."

- [ ] Funding history (below form):
  - Show recent accepted DEPOSIT/WITHDRAWAL rows (last 30 days)
  - Display: timestamp, associate, type, amount (native + EUR), note

### Technical Constraints

**Funding Draft Storage** [Source: docs/prd/epic-5-implementation-guide.md#Task-5.4.1]:
```python
# In-memory draft storage (session-based)
class FundingService:
    def __init__(self):
        self._drafts: Dict[str, FundingDraft] = {}  # UUID -> draft
        
    def create_funding_draft(self, associate_id: int, event_type: str, 
                           amount_native: Decimal, currency: str, 
                           note: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
        """Create draft with UUID for tracking."""
        draft_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        
        # Validate amount must be positive
        if amount_native <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Amount must be positive")
            
        # Validate event type
        if event_type not in ['DEPOSIT', 'WITHDRAWAL']:
            raise ValueError("Invalid event type")
            
        draft = FundingDraft(
            draft_id=draft_id,
            associate_id=associate_id,
            event_type=event_type,
            amount_native=amount_native,
            currency=currency,
            note=note,
            created_at_utc=utc_now_iso()
        )
        
        self._drafts[draft_id] = draft
        return draft_id
```

**Ledger Entry Creation for Funding** [Source: docs/prd/epic-5-implementation-guide.md#Task-5.4.2]:
```python
def accept_funding_draft(self, draft_id: str) -> str:
    """Accept draft and create ledger entry with FX snapshot."""
    draft = self._drafts.get(draft_id)
    if not draft:
        raise ValueError("Draft not found")
    
    # Get current FX rate
    fx_rate = self.fx_manager.get_fx_rate(draft.currency, date.today())
    
    # Calculate amount (negative for withdrawals)
    amount_native = draft.amount_native
    if draft.event_type == 'WITHDRAWAL':
        amount_native = -amount_native
    
    # Create ledger entry
    ledger_id = self.ledger_repo.insert_ledger_entry(
        entry_type=draft.event_type,
        associate_id=draft.associate_id,
        bookmaker_id=None,  # Funding is associate-level
        amount_native=amount_native,
        native_currency=draft.currency,
        fx_rate_snapshot=fx_rate,
        amount_eur=amount_native * fx_rate,
        note=draft.note
    )
    
    # Remove draft
    del self._drafts[draft_id]
    
    return ledger_id
```

**FX Rate Management** [Source: docs/architecture/data-architecture.md#fx_rates_daily-Cache-Strategy]:
```python
# Get current FX rate for funding events
def get_fx_rate(self, currency: str, date: date) -> Decimal:
    """Get FX rate for currency on specific date."""
    
    # Try to get today's rate from cache
    today_str = date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    rate_row = self.db.execute(
        "SELECT eur_per_unit FROM fx_rates_daily WHERE currency = ? AND rate_date = ?",
        (currency, today_str)
    ).fetchone()
    
    if rate_row:
        return Decimal(rate_row['eur_per_unit'])
    
    # If no rate for today, fetch from API
    return self.fetch_fx_rate_from_api(currency)
```

### Integration Points

**Upstream Dependencies**:
- Epic 0 (Foundation): FX rate system for currency conversion
- Epic 7 (User Management): Associates reference data for dropdown

**Downstream Consumers**:
- Story 5.5 (Associate Operations Hub): May reuse funding service for inline deposits/withdrawals
- Epic 6 (Reporting): Uses funding history for monthly statements

**UI Integration**:
- Extension of existing reconciliation page (src/ui/pages/6_reconciliation.py)
- Integration with ReconciliationService for real-time NET_DEPOSITS_EUR updates
- Session state management for draft persistence across page reruns

### Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Deposit Event**
```
Associate: Partner A
Event Type: DEPOSIT
Amount: 1000 AUD
Current FX Rate: 1 AUD = 0.65 EUR
Ledger Entry:
- entry_type: 'DEPOSIT'
- amount_native: 1000.00
- native_currency: 'AUD'
- fx_rate_snapshot: 0.65
- amount_eur: 650.00
Impact on Reconciliation:
- NET_DEPOSITS_EUR: increases by +650.00
- CURRENT_HOLDING_EUR: increases by +650.00
- DELTA: becomes more negative (short) until funds placed as bets
```

**Example 2: Withdrawal Event**
```
Associate: Partner B
Event Type: WITHDRAWAL
Amount: 500 EUR
Ledger Entry:
- entry_type: 'WITHDRAWAL'
- amount_native: -500.00
- native_currency: 'EUR'
- fx_rate_snapshot: 1.00
- amount_eur: -500.00
Impact on Reconciliation:
- NET_DEPOSITS_EUR: decreases by -500.00
- CURRENT_HOLDING_EUR: decreases by -500.00
- DELTA: becomes more positive (overholding) if not balanced
```

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Test Framework** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit-Testing]:
- Use pytest 7.0+ as testing framework
- Test file naming: `test_` prefix
- Test function naming: descriptive names (e.g., `test_funding_draft_creation()`)

**Test Structure** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test-Organization]:
```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── test_funding_service.py           # Core funding service tests
│   └── test_funding_validation.py       # Input validation tests
└── integration/
    └── test_funding_workflow.py         # End-to-end funding workflow
```

**Key Test Scenarios**:
```python
def test_funding_draft_creation():
    """Test draft creation with valid inputs"""
    
def test_funding_draft_validation_negative_amount():
    """Test draft creation rejects negative amounts"""
    
def test_accept_deposit_draft_creates_ledger_entry():
    """Test accepting deposit draft creates correct ledger entry"""
    
def test_accept_withdrawal_draft_creates_negative_ledger_entry():
    """Test accepting withdrawal draft creates negative ledger entry"""
    
def test_reject_funding_draft_removes_draft():
    """Test rejecting draft removes it without creating ledger entry"""
    
def test_fx_rate_fallback_for_funding():
    """Test funding uses current FX rate with API fallback"""
    
def test_funding_updates_reconciliation_calculations():
    """Test accepted funding updates NET_DEPOSITS_EUR correctly"""
    
def test_funding_history_display():
    """Test funding history shows correct recent entries"""
```

**UI Testing Approach** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Integration-Testing]:
For Streamlit pending funding interface:
1. **Unit tests** for FundingService business logic
2. **Unit tests** for form validation and draft management
3. **Integration tests** for complete funding workflow
4. **Manual testing** for form interaction and reconciliation updates

### Test Data Requirements

**Required Test Fixtures**:
- Multiple associates with different currencies
- Various FX rates for different dates
- Existing ledger entries for reconciliation testing
- Edge cases: missing FX rates, invalid associates, negative amounts

**Funding Draft Test Scenarios**:
- Valid deposit and withdrawal drafts
- Invalid drafts (negative amounts, invalid event types)
- Draft acceptance with FX rate available/unavailable
- Draft rejection scenarios
- Multiple drafts for same associate

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-11-04T08:32:00Z

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid architecture and adherence to coding standards. The FundingService is well-structured with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive validation, and robust error handling. The UI component follows established patterns and provides good user experience with clear feedback. However, there are several critical issues that need to be addressed before this story can be considered ready for production.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed as the core implementation is sound. The code follows established patterns and maintains good separation of concerns.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to PEP 8, type hints, and Decimal usage
- Project Structure: ✓ Correct file placement and module organization  
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Test file has significant issues with imports and mocked dependencies
- All ACs Met: ✗ Missing integration with reconciliation page and database schema issues

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Reviewed FundingService implementation for proper validation and error handling
- [x] Verified UI component follows established patterns and provides good UX
- [x] Confirmed proper Decimal usage throughout the implementation
- [ ] Fix test file imports and remove non-existent dependencies (FundingDraftStatus, LedgerEntryService)
- [ ] Integrate pending funding component into reconciliation page (6_reconciliation.py)
- [ ] Verify database schema compatibility with ledger_entries table structure
- [ ] Add integration tests for complete funding workflow
- [ ] Add proper session state management for draft persistence across page refreshes

### Security Review

The implementation includes proper input validation and SQL injection protection through parameterized queries. No security concerns identified.

### Performance Considerations

The in-memory draft storage approach is appropriate for the session-based use case. FX rate fetching could benefit from caching, but this is handled by the existing FX manager. No performance concerns identified.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review. However, the following files need updates from the development team:

- `tests/unit/test_funding_service.py` - Fix imports and remove mocked dependencies
- `src/ui/pages/6_reconciliation.py` - Add pending funding component integration
- Database schema - Verify compatibility with current ledger_entries structure
