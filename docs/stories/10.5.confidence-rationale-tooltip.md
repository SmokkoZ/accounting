# Story 10.5: Confidence Rationale Tooltip

## Status
Draft

## Story
As an operator, I want the confidence badge to surface its rationale, using the text generated by `format_confidence_badge` in `src/ui/utils/formatters.py:69`, so I can understand why a row is flagged without guessing when I hover or focus the badge in `src/ui/components/bet_card.py:367`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Every confidence badge renders the tooltip text produced by the formatter, making the rationale identical to the computed value.
- [ ] Tooltip content is keyboard accessible (aria description and focusable) and never overlaps the approve/reject buttons.
- [ ] An accessible text node duplicates the tooltip copy for screen readers.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Inject the tooltip along the confidence badge render path in `bet_card.py`.
- Provide a fallback (title attribute or similar) when hover is unavailable.

## Dev Notes
- Keep the copy in sync with `format_confidence_badge` so the tooltip never drifts from the formatter output.

## Testing
- Add a unit test covering the tooltip text generation path to catch copy drift.
