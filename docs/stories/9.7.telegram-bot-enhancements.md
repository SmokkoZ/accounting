# Story 9.7: Telegram Bot Interaction Enhancements

## Status
Draft

## Story
As an admin, I want the Telegram interaction around balance, banking, and help gestures to feel like a single coherent assistant so associates can quickly confirm balances, copy reference IDs, and complete banking security steps without extra friction.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] After the balance/pending message is sent to Telegram, the bot uses the exact format documented in Story 9.3 (`DD/MM/YY Balance: <balance_native> <CUR>, pending balance: <pending_native> <CUR>.`) so every associate sees the consistent timestamped snapshot and the message is generated from the latest `bookmaker_balance_checks`.
- [ ] When the associate replies with `okay`, `correct`, or `ok` (case insensitive) to that balance message, the comment is treated as a balance confirmation and a new balance check record is persisted for that `(associate_id, bookmaker_id)` using the same FX rules and logging policies as the Streamlit button path.
- [ ] Bot responses that contain copy-worthy data (for example `Current chat ID: -1003295592833`) expose an inline tap-to-copy affordance so the associate can grab the chat ID or any other reference string without manually selecting text.
- [ ] The deposit and withdrawal security confirmation flow no longer generates a random numeric code; sending the plain text `confirm` (within the existing 5-minute window) finalizes the pending transaction and logs the confirmation attempt just as before.
- [ ] Sending `/help` in the Telegram chat returns a dedicated menu of all supported commands (balance checks, banking, chat tools, etc.) within a single reply so associates can see every option without guessing names.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Document existing Telegram commands and the desired menu layout under `/help`.
- [ ] Wire the Telegram reply handler to detect the text responses above, capture the chat context, and trigger the balance persistence path when `okay`/`correct`/`ok` arrives.
- [ ] Add copy affordances (buttons or structured text) to any bot reply that contains a templated data fragment that might need to be reused.
- [ ] Simplify the deposit/withdrawal handler so only `confirm` is accepted, and keep the existing timeout/logging semantics.
- [ ] Extend the `/help` handler to render the new dedicated command menu.

## Dev Notes

- Leverage the existing balance message builder/logging from Story 9.3 to keep format and observability consistent.
- Maintain the same auditing expectations for banking confirmations even though the code is removed; ensure the log contains who confirmed and when.
- The copy affordance should degrade gracefully for clients that cannot render buttons (plain text fallback or instructions).
