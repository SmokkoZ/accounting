# Story 10.8: Saved Views & URL State

## Status
Draft

## Story
As an operator, I want filters and layout choices to sync to `st.query_params` so reloading restores my saved view and, when query params are missing, the page falls back to a local preference file as described in `src/ui/utils/feature_flags.py:89`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Filter and toggle state (bookmaker, bet type, confidence, compact mode, auto-refresh) sync to `st.query_params` and update the URL whenever the operator changes them.
- [ ] Reloading a URL rehydrates the same selections, and when query params are not provided the page reads from a secure local pref file that expires after 30 days.
- [ ] Page captions document the saved-view behavior so operators know their filters are persistent, echoing the front-end goals in `docs/front-end-spec.md:1`.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Wrap the existing filter state in helpers that read/write query params via `feature_flags`.
- Implement local pref serialization (JSON or similar) for browsers without stable query params.

## Dev Notes
- Keep the stored preferences PII-free and encrypt or obfuscate file names to avoid exposing sensitive data.

## Testing
- Unit tests verify query params and local pref values load and save correctly.
