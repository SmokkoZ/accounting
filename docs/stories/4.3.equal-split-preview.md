# Story 4.3: Equal-Split Preview

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As the operator**, I want to see a detailed preview of equal-split settlement calculations before committing so I can verify the math and understand the financial impact.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Settlement preview shows after outcome selection:
  - **Per-bet net gains** in EUR (WON: stake×odds-stake, LOST: -stake, VOID: 0)
  - **Surebet profit** = sum of all per-bet net gains
  - **Participants count** (N): all bets get seat, VOID gets non-staked seat
  - **Per-surebet share** = surebet_profit ÷ N (rounded to 2 decimal places)
- [ ] Per-participant calculation display:
  - **Principal returned** (for WON bets only): original stake in EUR
  - **Per-surebet share** (for staked seats only): equal share amount
  - **Total amount** = principal_returned + per_surebet_share
  - **FX snapshot** used for conversion (frozen at preview time)
- [ ] Ledger entry preview shows:
  - Associate name, bookmaker
  - Outcome status (WON/LOST/VOID)
  - EUR amounts with frozen FX rates
  - Settlement batch ID (UUID preview)
- [ ] Validation and warnings:
  - **All-VOID case**: warn "No profit/loss to split - admin gets 0 seat"
  - **Multi-currency**: show FX rates used for each bet
  - **Loss scenarios**: show negative amounts clearly
  - **Precision**: all Decimal calculations rounded to 2 places
- [ ] Integration with Story 4.2:
  - Preview updates automatically when outcomes change
  - Shows same surebet selected in settlement interface
  - "Confirm Settlement" button disabled until preview loads

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 4.2 (Settlement Interface):
- Settlement interface with base outcome selection and individual overrides established [Source: docs/stories/4.2.settlement-interface-kickoff-order.md#L23-L31]
- Bet outcome data structure and validation patterns [Source: docs/stories/4.2.settlement-interface-kickoff-order.md#L27-L34]
- UI integration points for preview display [Source: docs/stories/4.2.settlement-interface-kickoff-order.md#UI-Layout-Reference]
- Streamlit session state for selected surebet and outcomes [Source: docs/stories/4.2.settlement-interface-kickoff-order.md#Technical-Constraints]

### Data Models

**Surebet Settlement Logic** [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-coverage-settlement.md#L89-L108]:
```python
# Equal-split calculation formula:
# 1. Per-bet net gains in EUR:
#    WON: (stake × odds) - stake
#    LOST: -stake  
#    VOID: 0

# 2. Surebet profit = sum(per_bet_net_gains)

# 3. Participants (N):
#    - WON/LOST bets: staked seat (gets share)
#    - VOID bets: non-staked seat (gets share but no principal)

# 4. Per-surebet share = surebet_profit ÷ N

# 5. Per-participant total:
#    WON: principal_returned + per_surebet_share
#    LOST: 0 + per_surebet_share  
#    VOID: 0 + per_surebet_share (non-staked seat)
```

**bets table** [Source: docs/architecture/data-architecture.md#L194-L226]:
```sql
-- Key fields for settlement calculation:
stake TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Original stake amount
odds TEXT NOT NULL,            -- Bet odds
currency TEXT NOT NULL,        -- Native currency for FX conversion
outcome TEXT,                  -- WON/LOST/VOID (set during settlement)
status TEXT NOT NULL,          -- matched → settled
```

**FX Conversion Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/data-architecture.md#L306-L320]:
```sql
-- fx_rates_daily table structure:
CREATE TABLE fx_rates_daily (
    currency TEXT NOT NULL,
    rate REAL NOT NULL,        -- Rate to convert TO EUR
    date TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (currency, date)
);

-- Settlement uses frozen FX snapshot at preview/settlement time
-- Store as: fx_rate_snapshot in ledger_entries
```

### Core Settlement Service

**SettlementService Class** [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-implementation-guide.md#Task-4.3.1]:
```python
class SettlementService:
    """Service for settling surebets with equal-split logic."""
    
    def preview_settlement(
        self,
        surebet_id: int,
        outcomes: Dict[int, BetOutcome]
    ) -> SettlementPreview:
        """
        Preview settlement calculation without committing to ledger.
        
        Returns SettlementPreview with:
        - per_bet_outcomes: mapping of bet_id → outcome
        - per_bet_net_gains: mapping of bet_id → Decimal EUR
        - surebet_profit_eur: total profit/loss in EUR
        - num_participants: count of all bets (VOID included)
        - participants: list with associate_alias, seat_type
        - per_surebet_share_eur: equal split amount
        - ledger_entries: preview of entries to be created
        """
        
    def _calculate_net_gain(self, bet, outcome: BetOutcome) -> Decimal:
        """Calculate net gain for a bet in EUR."""
        
    def _determine_participants(
        self,
        bets: List,
        outcomes: Dict[int, BetOutcome]
    ) -> List[Participant]:
        """
        Determine participants and seat types.
        - WON/LOST bets get staked seat
        - VOID bets get non-staked seat (still participate!)
        """
```

**BetOutcome Enum** [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-implementation-guide.md#L809-L813]:
```python
class BetOutcome(Enum):
    """Possible bet outcomes."""
    WON = "WON"
    LOST = "LOST"
    VOID = "VOID"
```

### UI Component Specifications

**Preview Display Integration** [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#L45-L67]:
- Add preview section below outcome selection in Story 4.2 interface
- Use `st.expander()` for detailed calculation breakdown
- Display as formatted table with currency formatting
- Update automatically when outcomes change (Streamlit rerun)

**Streamlit Components** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#L55-L70]:
- `st.markdown()` - For calculation headers and formulas
- `st.metric()` - For key numbers (profit, share amount)
- `st.dataframe()` - For per-participant breakdown table
- `st.warning()` - For validation warnings (all-VOID, losses)
- `st.columns()` - For side-by-side display of calculations

### File Locations

Based on architecture documentation:
- `src/services/settlement_service.py` - Core settlement logic and preview calculation [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#L75]
- `src/ui/pages/2_verified_bets.py` - Extend Story 4.2 settlement tab with preview section [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#L27]
- `src/utils/fx_utils.py` - FX conversion utilities for EUR conversion [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#L82]

### Technical Constraints

**Decimal Precision** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#L155-L195]:
- All currency calculations must use `Decimal` type
- No float operations on money values
- Round to 2 decimal places: `.quantize(Decimal("0.01"))`
- Store as TEXT in SQLite (no REAL/DOUBLE for currency)

**FX Rate Handling** [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-coverage-settlement.md#L89-L108]:
- Get current FX rate at preview time
- Freeze rate in preview display (show "Rate: 0.60 EUR/AUD")
- Same rate used for principal conversion and net gain calculation
- Handle missing FX rates gracefully with error message

**UTC Timestamps** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#L198-L226]:
- All timestamps in UTC with "Z" suffix
- Use `datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z"` for current time
- Store timestamps as TEXT in ISO 8601 format

### Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Normal Settlement (Side A Wins)**
```
Side A (WON): €100 @ 1.90
- Payout: €190
- Net gain: €90
- Principal returned: €100

Side B (LOST): €80 @ 2.10  
- Net gain: -€80
- Principal returned: €0

Surebet profit: €90 + (-€80) = €10
Participants: 2 (both staked seats)
Per-surebet share: €10 ÷ 2 = €5

Side A total: €100 + €5 = €105
Side B total: €0 + €5 = €5
```

**Example 2: With VOID Bet**
```
Side A (VOID): €100 @ 1.90
- Net gain: €0
- Principal returned: €0
- Seat type: non-staked

Side B (LOST): €80 @ 2.10
- Net gain: -€80  
- Principal returned: €0
- Seat type: staked

Surebet profit: €0 + (-€80) = -€80
Participants: 2 (VOID still gets seat)
Per-surebet share: -€80 ÷ 2 = -€40

Side A total: €0 + €0 = €0 (non-staked seat)
Side B total: €0 + (-€40) = -€40
```

**Example 3: All-VOID Edge Case**
```
Side A (VOID): €100 @ 1.90
- Net gain: €0
- Principal returned: €0
- Seat type: non-staked

Side B (VOID): €80 @ 2.10
- Net gain: €0
- Principal returned: €0  
- Seat type: non-staked

Surebet profit: €0 + €0 = €0
Participants: 2 (both non-staked seats)
Per-surebet share: €0 ÷ 2 = €0

Side A total: €0 + €0 = €0
Side B total: €0 + €0 = €0
```

### Integration Points

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Test Framework** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#L34-L41]:
- Use pytest 7.0+ as testing framework
- Test file naming: `test_` prefix  
- Test function naming: descriptive names (e.g., `test_equal_split_calculation_two_winners()`)

**Test Structure** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#L54-L77]:
```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── test_settlement_service.py        # Core settlement logic tests
│   ├── test_equal_split_algorithm.py     # Equal-split calculation tests
│   └── test_fx_conversion.py            # FX conversion and rounding tests
└── integration/
    └── test_settlement_preview_flow.py   # End-to-end preview workflow
```

**Key Test Scenarios**:
```python
def test_equal_split_calculation_two_winners():
    """Test equal-split with two winning bets"""
    
def test_equal_split_with_void_bet():
    """Test equal-split with one VOID bet (non-staked seat)"""
    
def test_equal_split_all_void_edge_case():
    """Test all-VOID scenario (0 profit, N participants)"""
    
def test_fx_conversion_precision():
    """Test Decimal precision and rounding in FX conversion"""
    
def test_preview_data_structure():
    """Test SettlementPreview dataclass structure and fields"""
```

**UI Testing Approach** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#L559-L564]:
For Streamlit preview display:
1. **Unit tests** for settlement calculation functions
2. **Unit tests** for FX conversion and Decimal precision
3. **Integration tests** for preview data flow from Story 4.2
4. **Manual testing** for preview display formatting and user experience
