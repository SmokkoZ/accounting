# Quality Gate Decision
quality_gate:
  decision: CONCERNS
  rationale: "Implementation meets all acceptance criteria with excellent unit test coverage, but there are concerns around error recovery user feedback and missing end-to-end test coverage for the complete user workflow."
  critical_issues:
    - "Missing E2E tests for complete resend workflow"
    - "Limited error recovery UI feedback for Telegram API failures"
  recommendations: 
    - "Add E2E tests covering full resend workflow from UI button click to Telegram delivery"
    - "Enhance user feedback for failed sends with clearer retry instructions and error categorization"
    - "Verify accessibility compliance for keyboard navigation and screen reader support"
  next_steps:
    - "Implement automated E2E tests for resend workflow"
    - "Conduct accessibility audit of outbox table and controls"
    - "Add enhanced error messaging in UI for better user experience"
