# Quality Gate Decision
quality_gate:
  decision: PASS
  rationale: "Implementation meets all functional requirements with excellent test coverage. The auto-refresh helper provides robust state management with proper rate limiting and graceful degradation. Query parameter persistence enables saved views, and fragment detection ensures compatibility. Performance concerns are mitigated through rate limiting and efficient fragment updates."
  critical_issues: []
  recommendations: 
    - "Consider adding performance monitoring for auto-refresh frequency under high load"
    - "Document auto-refresh behavior in user-facing help text"
    - "Monitor fragment support across different Streamlit versions"
  next_steps:
    - "No immediate action required"
    - "Monitor production performance after deployment"
    - "Gather user feedback on auto-refresh behavior"
