  decision: PASS
  rationale: "Implementation fully meets all acceptance criteria with excellent technical approach. The compact mode feature provides significant UX benefits with minimal risk. Code quality is high, following existing patterns, and includes appropriate test coverage for the thumbnail functionality."
  critical_issues: []
  recommendations: 
    - "Add integration tests for query parameter persistence across page refreshes"
    - "Implement E2E tests for complete user workflow including toggle persistence"
    - "Add performance monitoring for toggle usage patterns"
    - "Update user documentation to explain compact mode benefits"
  next_steps:
    - "Implement integration tests for session state management"
    - "Add E2E tests for browser session persistence"
    - "Deploy to production with feature flag for gradual rollout"
