# Quality Gate Decision
quality_gate:
  decision: PASS
  rationale: "The implementation successfully delivers keyboard shortcuts with proper focus gating, help overlay functionality, and session state persistence. The solution follows established patterns from Associate Operations page and provides comprehensive keyboard accessibility. Test coverage is thorough with proper focus management and session persistence validation."
  critical_issues: []
  recommendations: 
    - "Consider adding keyboard shortcut customization options for power users"
    - "Monitor user adoption patterns to identify most-used shortcuts"
    - "Add visual indicators when keyboard shortcuts are enabled/disabled"
    - "Consider expanding shortcuts to other pages based on user feedback"
  next_steps:
    - "Deploy with keyboard shortcuts enabled by default"
    - "Collect usage analytics on shortcut adoption"
    - "Monitor user feedback for shortcut effectiveness"
    - "Plan expansion to other workflow pages"

# Success Criteria
success_criteria:
  - "Page-local hotkeys (A/R/E//?) trigger correct actions when focus is not inside input"
  - "Help overlay opened with ? lists active shortcuts and closes with Escape"
  - "Operators can disable hotkeys via toggle with session storage persistence"
  - "Unit tests assert session flag toggles and overlay renders expected list of shortcuts"
  - "Keyboard shortcuts mirror focus gating pattern from Associate Operations page"
