# Quality Gate Decision
quality_gate:
  decision: CONCERNS
  rationale: "Implementation meets all functional requirements with comprehensive testing (91% coverage) and robust architecture. However, reliability concerns exist around file system dependency and error handling edge cases. The saved view functionality works correctly but has potential failure modes in constrained environments that need attention."
  critical_issues: []
  recommendations: 
    - "Add graceful degradation for file system write failures (currently logs warning only)"
    - "Implement retry logic for corrupted preference files"
    - "Add monitoring for preference file failures in production"
    - "Consider adding validation for URL length limits before parameter sync"
  next_steps:
    - "Address file system error handling improvements"
    - "Add production monitoring for preference failures"
    - "Complete manual verification of Streamlit UI functionality"
