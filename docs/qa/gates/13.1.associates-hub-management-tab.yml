  coverage_percentage: 75%
  gaps_identified:
    - "Management filters lack risk-flag controls and ND/last-activity sorts, so AC4 is unmet."
    - "Per-associate actions queue state but cannot switch tabs automatically, leaving AC8 incomplete."

  decision: CONCERNS
  rationale: >
    Story 13.1 delivers the core inline editing and reassignment safeguards, but it still violates two acceptance
    criteria: the filter/sort experience is missing the specified risk and ND/last-activity options, and quick actions
    fail to take the operator to the requested tab. These gaps materially impact usability, so the gate is marked CONCERNS
    until the behaviours or requirements are reconciled.
  critical_issues:
    - "Add the risk-flag filter plus ND and last-activity sorting options to `render_filters` and the repository."
    - "Update quick actions so 'Go to Overview'/'View history' actually navigate to the destination tab (or re-scope the AC)."
  recommendations:
    - "Implement the missing risk filter and ND/last-activity sort orders, and cover them with unit tests."
    - "Adopt a tab implementation that permits programmatic selection (or reroute to dedicated pages) so quick actions complete the navigation."
    - "Automate an integration/AppTest flow that exercises filters, inline edits, and balance-aware reassignment."
  next_steps:
    - "Prioritise AC4 remediation before shipping the Management tab widely."
    - "Decide whether to change the UX requirement or engineering approach for AC8, then implement the agreed path."
    - "Extend AppTest coverage beyond the smoke test to include filter persistence, edits, and reassignment confirmations."

technical_debt:
  identified_issues:
    - "Risk filter and ND/last-activity sorts required by AC4 are not implemented."
    - "Quick actions depend on manual tab clicks despite AC8 mandating an automatic switch."
    - "No automated coverage yet for the end-to-end Management tab workflow (filters, edits, reassignment)."
  severity: High
  remediation_priority: High
  estimated_effort: 8 hours

success_criteria:
  - "Filter bar includes the requested risk-flag selector and ND/last-activity sort orders, all persisted in session state."
  - "Clicking 'Go to Overview' or 'View history' takes the operator to the corresponding tab without an extra manual click."
  - "An automated test opens the Associates Hub, applies filters, edits data, and exercises reassignment confirmation to guard against regressions."
