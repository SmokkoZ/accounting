# Quality Gate Decision
quality_gate:
  decision: CONCERNS
  rationale: "Implementation meets all functional requirements with excellent UX design and comprehensive validation. However, high integration risk exists due to live rate limit enforcement changes without deployment safeguards. The UI allows real-time configuration changes that immediately affect production message delivery without proper rollback mechanisms or safety nets."
  critical_issues: ["Live production changes without staging workflow", "No emergency rollback capability"]
  recommendations: 
    - "Add configuration staging/approval workflow before changes take effect"
    - "Implement emergency rollback capability for problematic rate limit changes"
    - "Add rate limit change audit trail with timestamps and operator attribution"
    - "Consider adding 'safe mode' that prevents drastic reductions in throughput"
    - "Add monitoring alerts for rate limit configuration changes that impact delivery"
  next_steps:
    - "Implement staging workflow for configuration changes"
    - "Add emergency rollback mechanisms"
    - "Enhance audit trail capabilities"
    - "Add production monitoring and alerting"
    - "Complete end-to-end testing in production environment"
