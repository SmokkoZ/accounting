# Quality Gate Decision

  decision: CONCERNS
  rationale: "While the implementation appears comprehensive with good test coverage, the critical risk level (25) due to high complexity, financial data sensitivity, and integration risk raises concerns. The migration strategy and mixed data handling require additional validation. Performance impact of real-time ledger writes needs benchmarking. Security validation for financial data access is required before production deployment."
  critical_issues:
    - "Critical risk score (25) exceeds acceptable threshold for production deployment"
    - "Financial data sensitivity requires enhanced security validation"
    - "Performance impact of real-time ledger writes not yet benchmarked"
  recommendations: 
    - "Conduct performance benchmarking of settlement flows with stake placement enabled"
    - "Perform security audit of ledger entry access controls and financial data handling"
    - "Validate migration rollback procedures on production-like dataset"
    - "Add E2E tests covering mixed historical data scenarios across all dashboards"
    - "Implement monitoring and alerting for ledger write failures during placement"
  next_steps:
    - "Complete performance benchmarking before production enablement"
    - "Security audit and remediation of financial data access controls"
    - "E2E test coverage validation for mixed data scenarios"
    - "Monitoring implementation for ledger write failures"
