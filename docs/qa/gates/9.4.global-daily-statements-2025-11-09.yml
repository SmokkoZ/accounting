# Quality Gate Decision

  decision: CONCERNS
  rationale: "All functional requirements are successfully implemented with excellent unit test coverage (2/2 tests passing). However, the high risk score (16) due to critical Telegram API integration dependencies, missing integration/performance tests, and related statement system integration failures warrant concerns. The feature handles sensitive financial data at scale across ~750 external partner chats, and 5 integration test failures in the broader statement system indicate potential data generation issues that could impact message content."
  critical_issues: 
    - "Missing integration tests validating complete UI→Service→Telegram API flow"
    - "No performance/load testing for 750+ chat scenarios"
    - "Heavy dependency on Telegram API without documented fallback procedures"
    - "5 integration test failures in statement system affecting data retrieval and formatting"
  recommendations: 
    - "Add integration tests using Telegram API mocking to validate complete message delivery pipeline"
    - "Implement performance/load testing to validate 750+ chat processing and rate limiting behavior"
    - "Add monitoring/alerting for delivery failure rates and Telegram API health"
    - "Document manual override procedures for extended Telegram outages"
    - "Consider message batching optimizations for future scalability"
  next_steps:
    - "Implement integration tests with mocked Telegram API"
    - "Create performance test suite for 750+ chat scenarios"
    - "Set up production monitoring and alerting"
    - "Document operational procedures for Telegram outages"
