# Quality Gate Decision

  decision: CONCERNS
  rationale: "Implementation meets all functional requirements with excellent test coverage and proper error handling. However, real-time performance concerns exist with 1-second refresh intervals and potential database contention under high load. The Force Ingest admin gating is properly implemented but requires operational monitoring."
  critical_issues: []
  recommendations: 
    - "Implement caching layer for pending_photos queries to reduce database load"
    - "Add performance monitoring for TTL refresh frequency under load"
    - "Consider WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for more efficient real-time updates"
    - "Add rate limiting for Force Ingest operations to prevent abuse"
  next_steps:
    - "Implement database query optimization before production deployment"
    - "Add performance metrics monitoring for TTL refresh behavior"
    - "Conduct load testing with multiple concurrent users"
