# Quality Gate Decision
quality_gate:
  decision: CONCERNS
  rationale: "The implementation successfully delivers navigation restructuring and Telegram section creation with proper test coverage. However, there are usability concerns regarding the removal of JSON profile/created/updated columns which may impact administrative workflows. The new balance fields are well-implemented with proper sorting/filtering, but the migration from metadata columns to financial columns requires careful user training and may affect existing administrative processes."
  critical_issues:
    - "Potential loss of administrative visibility with removal of profile/created/updated metadata"
    - "User workflow disruption for admins who rely on creation/update timestamps for audit trails"
  recommendations: 
    - "Consider adding an optional admin view that shows historical metadata alongside balance information"
    - "Provide user training materials for the new navigation structure and balance-focused admin interface"
    - "Monitor user feedback on the navigation changes and be prepared to add breadcrumb navigation if needed"
    - "Ensure audit trail functionality is preserved through other means if timestamps were critical for compliance"
  next_steps:
    - "Deploy with user communication about navigation changes"
    - "Monitor admin user feedback on balance-focused interface"
    - "Prepare contingency plan for restoring metadata visibility if needed"
    - "Collect usage analytics on Telegram section adoption"
