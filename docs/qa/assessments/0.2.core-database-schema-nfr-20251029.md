## Non-Functional Requirements Evaluation

### Security
**Status: PASS**

- **Authentication**: Not applicable for this story
- **Authorization**: Properly implemented through associate roles (is_admin flag)
- **Data Protection**: Append-only ledger prevents financial data tampering
- **Input Validation**: Foreign key constraints prevent invalid relationships
- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries used throughout implementation

### Performance
**Status: PASS**

- **Response Time**: Optimized with appropriate indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Throughput**: WAL mode enables better concurrent access
- **Resource Usage**: SQLite pragmas configured for optimal memory usage
- **Scalability**: Schema design supports future growth with proper normalization

### Reliability
**Status: PASS**

- **Error Handling**: Database constraints prevent invalid data states
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- **Recovery**: SQLite's durability features with WAL mode
- **Consistency**: System Laws enforced through database triggers

### Maintainability
**Status: PASS**

- **Code Clarity**: Well-documented code with clear docstrings
- **Modularity**: Proper separation of concerns across modules
- **Testability**: Comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage of critical paths
- **Documentation**: Clear inline documentation and comments

## Overall NFR Status: PASS

All non-functional requirements have been adequately addressed in the implementation. The database schema is secure, performant, reliable, and maintainable.

## Recommendations

No immediate improvements required. The implementation follows best practices and adequately addresses all NFRs for this story.
