## Risk Matrix

| Risk Area | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|------------|
| Data corruption | Low | High | 3 | Append-only ledger with triggers |
| Schema drift | Low | Medium | 2 | Comprehensive schema validation |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | 2 | Proper indexing and WAL mode |
| Data inconsistency | Low | High | 3 | Foreign key constraints |
| Currency precision loss | Low | High | 3 | TEXT storage for Decimal values |

## Risk Summary

- **Critical Risks (≥9)**: 0
- **High Risks (6-8)**: 0
- **Medium Risks (3-5)**: 5
- **Low Risks (1-2)**: 0

## Overall Risk Assessment: LOW

All identified risks have been properly mitigated through the implementation of:
- Database triggers enforcing System Laws
- Comprehensive schema validation
- Proper indexing strategy
- Foreign key constraints
- Decimal serialization using TEXT storage

## Recommendations

No immediate action required. All risks are properly mitigated through the current implementation.
